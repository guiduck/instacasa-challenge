## Usage
### Comands

Install dependencies:

```sh
yarn (or npm i)
```

Done! Start the service:

```sh
yarn dev
```

#Development mode

```sh
# run the app in development mode
yarn dev
# next dev starts the application in development mode with hot-code reloading, error reporting, and more.
```
#Production mode

```sh
# When building the Next.js app for production, you'll want to use next build:
next build
# next build creates an optimized production build of your application. The output displays information about each route.

Size – The number of assets downloaded when navigating to the page client-side. The size for each route only includes its dependencies.
First Load JS – The number of assets downloaded when visiting the page from the server. The amount of JS shared by all is shown as a separate metric.

# Followed by either next start, when you want to start the production server:
next start
# next start starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with next build first.

# Or next export, when exporting the app as static HTML:
next export
# next export allows you to export your app to static HTML, which can be run standalone without the need of a Node.js server.

# For more information refer to  docs.

For more information refer to * [Next.js CLI](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli) docs.

"watch": ["src"],
    "ext": "ts",
    "execMap": {
        "ts": "sucrase-node src/server.ts"
    }
```

## Project Structure

* `src/controllers` follows the resource.controller name convention
* `src/schemas` follows the resource.schemas name convention
* `src/routes.ts` basic routing
* `src/server.ts` listening to port (3333)
